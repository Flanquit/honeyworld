               <p>We are a social enterprise whose goal is to bring many rural farmers into beekeeping as an income generating activity. We work with rural communities through training and provision of initial capital for those who want to venture into beekeeping as a business. In doing so, we aim to provide sustainable income to those in rural areas while fostering the conservation of the environment.</p>
