Our objective is to impact the communities we work with by providing them sustainable livelihoods through providing beekeeping training, equipment and advice on modern beekeeping while also assuring them of a ready market for their honey. We contribute to economic development by increasing rural farming familiesâ€™ incomes through a sustainable supply chain, producing high quality honey, which we buy at fair market prices. We promote the conservation of the environment by encouraging the combining of beekeeping with other farming activities to reap the benefits of cross pollination by bees. We partner with various organizations, individuals and business owners that are motivated by the opportunity to make a financial contribution and improve the lives of people in the communities where we work through donations or as social impact investors. We therefore enable our funders to fulfill their social and philanthropic goals by partnering with us. We are committed to producing top quality, pure unadulterated honey which is affordable and suitable for both local and foreign markets. Guided by our values, we endeavor to uphold the highest quality standards to provide a carefully processed and professionally packaged product. In addition to our pure natural honey, we also offer beekeeping training and we supply beekeeping equipment to passionate beekeepers and those already in the trade. Our firm belief in teamwork and collaboration enables us to handhold and mentor passionate beekeepers until they become successful and self-sufficient.
